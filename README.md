# Tank Test

It took me a while to work out how to animate each part
of the tank separately. What I didn't understand was
that once you've created a hierarchy of sprite renderers
under a GameObject then you can add each on of those
sprites to the animator separately.

I found this video which helped me "rediscover" this fact.

It's from Noah from Black Thorn Productions. I watched some
earlier videos of his which inspired me.
